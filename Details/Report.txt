We want to create an application for managing money lent by a Person as private loans.
The client has been doing this for quite a while now and has managed its data in Excel manually.
The client wants an application that can be used by him to easily manage all the stuff.
The client's demands are quite simple he wants an application to be used on his laptop(Windows OS) only,
The client is going to be an only user so we don't need admin/user sign-in or account management.


And application to decide what is the amount to be paid to him per month based on information put in as input(amount taken, decided interest, duration of the loan)
By-default installment date 1st day of every month(This can be flexible based on Your Creativity).


Following are the images of the previous same project which was based on PHP and web application.
The client quite liked the Frontend from there, so I'm a reference for YOu to take from there.

To make something clear in the images forwarded to You, You can see we had separate sections for Loan Type & plans,
whether it is decided to append those functions in the creation of loans in this application.

So these options should be specified while creating a loan and would be visible in the loan's description only.
